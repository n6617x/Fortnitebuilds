After over 3 years of free service, the Fortnite Builds Archive will be officially discontinued.

What started as a small side project to preserve Fortnite’s history turned into something incredible. The archive grew beyond anything I expected — averaging over 3 petabytes of downloads every month. Seeing that level of interest and support from the community has meant the world to me.

Unfortunately, due to rising storage and bandwidth costs, I can’t continue to keep the download servers online. There’s no backing behind this project, just me, and after a lot of thought, I’ve made the difficult decision to shut it down.

I want to thank every single person who supported, downloaded, shared, or contributed over the years. This project wouldn’t have lasted as long as it did without you.

It’s been an amazing journey, and I’m truly grateful for all of it. ❤️
